    "text": "Deadly Crossings: The Human Cost of Migration in the Americas is a data-driven storytelling project that explores the perilous journeys migrants undertake across the Americas. Combining detailed data analysis with personal narratives, this project sheds light on the human lives behind the statistics of missing and deceased migrants.\nThrough interactive maps, visualizations, and first-person accounts, the project highlights the scale and complexity of migration routes-from the deadly deserts of the US-Mexico border to the treacherous Darién Gap jungle and dangerous Caribbean crossings. It also examines the root causes driving migration, including economic hardship, political instability, and climate-related displacement.\nThis work aims to foster empathy, challenge harmful stereotypes, and inform policy discussions by connecting data with the lived experiences of migrants like Alisa Domingo, whose story anchors the narrative."
