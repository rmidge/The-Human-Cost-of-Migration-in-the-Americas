    "text": "“Even though I went to university for five years, finding work outside my family business was difficult. We were battling one of the worst food crises in the world, struggling to even be able to pay for flour or a pack of spaghetti.  I felt suffocated and discouraged in Venezuela…”\n- Alisa Domingo\nThe decision to migrate is never made lightly. For families like Alisa’s, it often comes after exhausting all other options. The root causes of migration in the Americas are complex and interconnected, ranging from economic collapse to political instability and climate-related disasters (International Organization for Migration (IOM) 2024).\nAlisa’s story begins in Venezuela, where economic collapse left her family with nothing (Domingo and Loeza 2025). She immigrated to Peru where she worked multiple jobs and continued to struggle to survive. Finally, she made the difficult decision to leave everything behind and seek a better life in the United States. The journey north is fraught with danger at every step. From the treacherous Darién Gap to the scorching deserts of the US-Mexico border, migrants face life-threatening challenges in their search for safety and opportunity.",

    "text": "Personal Stories: Beyond the Numbers\n\nAlisa’s Story\nAfter a long and difficult journey, Alisa found hope in the U.S., building a new life with her partner, Alex, and preparing for the birth of their daughter. Tragedy struck when Alex was killed, leaving Alisa to face motherhood alone. Despite immense loss and ongoing uncertainty about her immigration status, Alisa’s resilience endures. Her story is a powerful reminder that behind every migration statistic is a human life, full of hope and courage.\n\n← Previous: Introduction Next: Conclusion →",

    "text": "Mother and child\nArifur Rahman on Unsplash\nAlisa’s words cut through the noise and stereotypes surrounding migration (Domingo and Loeza 2025). Her story is one of thousands-people who leave everything behind seeking safety and a better future for their families. Yet, despite their hopes, these journeys are fraught with danger.\nIn January 2024 alone, over 250 migrants died or went missing across the Americas-the deadliest month on record (International Organization for Migration (IOM) 2024). These numbers are not just statistics; they represent mothers, fathers, children, and individuals like Alisa, whose lives hang in the balance or have been tragically lost. Understanding this human cost is essential to grasping the scale and urgency of the migration crisis today.",

    "text": "Regions and Incidents\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Each point represents an incident where migrants were reported missing or deceased. The size of the circle indicates the density of casualties. Click on points for detailed information.\n\nTemporal patterns: Incidents of migrants casualties by region\nWhile the map highlights where these tragic incidents occur, it’s also important to understand how the scale of the crisis has changed over time. The following chart illustrates trends in reported deaths and disappearances across different regions of the Americas, revealing how risks have evolved in recent years.\nNorth America consistently accounts for the highest number of cases, with notable increases in recent years. Central America, the Caribbean, and South America also show persistent and, at times, rising numbers, reflecting the widespread risks faced by migrants throughout the region. This trend highlights the ongoing and growing dangers associated with migration routes across the Americas.\n\nFigure 2: The data reveals a concerning upward trend in migrant deaths and disappearances over the past decade. Each number represents a life lost, a family shattered, and a community forever changed.\nTo better capture recent developments and short-term fluctuations, the next chart breaks down these incidents by month. This view reveals not only long-term trends but also seasonal patterns and sudden spikes in migrant deaths and disappearances across the Americas. The recent spike in January 2024 represents the deadliest month on record, with over 250 lives lost.\n\nFigure 3: The interactive graph above shows the monthly toll of migrant deaths and disappearances. Use your mouse to hover over the points to see the exact number of deaths and disappearances for each month. The red line represents the raw data, while the blue line shows the smoothed trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings\n\n\n\n\nThe US-Mexico border remains the deadliest crossing, accounting for 75% of all incidents.\nThe Darién Gap between Colombia and Panama (the land bridge between Central and South America) has seen a surge in deaths, becoming the third most dangerous route.\nDespite increased awareness, the number of deaths continues to rise.\n\n\n\n\n\nFactors Driving the Increase\nSeveral interconnected factors contribute to the rising death toll:\n\nPolicy Changes: Stricter border policies often push migrants toward more dangerous routes\nClimate Impact: Extreme weather events make crossings more hazardous\nEconomic Pressures: Growing economic disparities drive more people to attempt dangerous journeys\nPolitical Instability: Unrest in various countries forces more people to flee\n\n\n\n← About this Project Next: The Journey →",

Blending data analysis with the deeply personal journey of Alisa Domingo, this project brings to light the human stories behind the statistics of missing and deceased migrants.\nThrough interactive maps, visualizations, and Alisa Domingo’s personal story, this project reveals the scale and dangers of migration routes across the Americas. It explores why migrants risk these journeys, the legal barriers they face, and calls for urgent action to protect their dignity and lives.\nThis project was completed as part of MUSA 6951: Communication in Urban Spatial Analytics at the University of Pennsylvania, under the guidance of Dr. Elizabeth Delmelle.",
