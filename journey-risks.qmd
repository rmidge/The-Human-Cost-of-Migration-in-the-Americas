The decision to migrate is never made lightly. For families like Alisa's, it often comes after exhausting all other options. The root causes of migration in the Americas are complex and interconnected, ranging from economic collapse to political instability and climate-related disasters [@IOM2024].


Alisa's story begins in Venezuela, where economic collapse left her family with nothing [@domingo_loeza_2025]. She immigrated to Peru where she worked multiple jobs and continued to struggle to survive. Finally, she made the difficult decision to leave everything behind and seek a better life in the United States. The journey north is fraught with danger at every step. From the treacherous Darién Gap to the scorching deserts of the US-Mexico border, migrants face life-threatening challenges in their search for safety and opportunity.

> "The jungle is known to have a curse, a curse of separating people. I knew how many people died on this journey and of the dangers that lay ahead, whether it was animals or murderers. I felt their blood on my feet with every step I took and I clung to my cousin and begged him to stay by my side, in fear of being left alone in this cursed jungle."  
> - Alisa Domingo

The Darién Gap is a notoriously remote and hazardous stretch of swampland and dense rainforest spanning about 62 miles along the border between Colombia and Panama. This region forms a critical, yet perilous, link in the migration route toward the United States [@IOM2024]. 

Migrants from Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean often enter South America through countries with fewer visa restrictions, then travel north until they reach the Darién Gap. Crossing the Gap typically means trekking on foot for five to eight days through unforgiving jungle terrain, facing threats from the environment, wildlife, and criminal groups. Some with greater resources attempt to bypass part of the jungle by sea, shortening the overland journey to two or three days.

Recent data from the [IOM](https://www.iom.int/migration-and-refugees/migration-data) shows that the Darién Gap has seen a surge in deaths, becoming the third most dangerous route. Many migrants, like Alisa, witness firsthand the tragic consequences—encountering the remains of those who did not survive. For most, the experience is harrowing and life-altering, a stark reminder of the risks faced by thousands who attempt this crossing each year.

> "I spent 16 days walking through Mexico with the traveling group. To avoid the beaming heat of the Mexican sun, we mostly walked at night. But then we were met with the stark cold rain. The worst part of my journey through Mexico was the fear. Sleep was nearly impossible because I always had to stay on high alert. There were rumors of kidnappings and murders on the trail we were on, which is why we always slept in groups of at least 15 people."
