# The Human Cost of Migration in the Americas

This repository contains a Quarto website that explores and visualizes migration patterns, risks, and human costs across the Americas. The project uses data from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to create an interactive and informative web experience.

## Project Overview

This website presents a comprehensive analysis of migration patterns in the Americas, focusing on:
- Migration routes and their associated risks
- Casualty statistics and incident mapping
- Regional migration patterns
- Interactive visualizations of migration data

## Website Structure

The website consists of several key sections:
- **Introduction**: Overview of migration in the Americas
- **The Journey**: Analysis of migration routes and associated risks
- **Conclusion**: Key findings and implications
- **About**: Project information and methodology

## Technical Details

This project is built using:
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for website generation
- R for data analysis and visualization
- Interactive maps and charts for data presentation

All data analysis and visualization code is available in the [IOM_Data_Analysis_Visuals.Rmd](IOM_Data_Analysis_Visuals.Rmd) file, which includes:
- Data processing and cleaning
- Statistical analysis
- Interactive map generation
- Time series visualizations
- Regional breakdowns

## Data Sources

This project uses data from the [IOM Missing Migrants Project](https://missingmigrants.iom.int/downloads), downloaded in Fall 2024. The Missing Migrants Project tracks deaths and disappearances of migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, who have died or gone missing in the process of migration towards an international destination.

Important notes about the data:
- The figures represent minimum estimates, as many deaths during migration go unrecorded
- Data collection began in 2014
- Each number represents a person, as well as the family and community they leave behind
- The data is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License

The project incorporates the personal narrative of Alisa Domingo from [El TÃ­mpano's "I'm not a criminal; I am only a mother"](https://www.eltimpano.org/mi-historia/im-not-a-criminal-i-am-only-a-mother-a-grueling-journey-from-venezuela-to-the-united-states-ends-in-uncertainty/) to provide context and humanize the data. Her story details a Venezuelan mother's journey to the United States and the challenges she faced along the way.
