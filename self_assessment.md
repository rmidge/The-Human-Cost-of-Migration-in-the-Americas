# Self-Assessment: The Human Cost of Migration in the Americas

## Narrative Structure and Emotional Impact

### Story Structure Beyond Linear Format
**Score: 2.5** - I'm pleased with how Alisa's story weaves through the narrative, though I would have loved to include more diverse perspectives, particularly from the Caribbean region.

### Narrative Organization
**Score: 3** - The story flows naturally from introduction through rising action to resolution. I'm particularly proud of how the personal stories connect with the broader trends.

### Focus on Key Insights
**Score: 2.5** - The narrative highlights important migration patterns while keeping technical details minimal. I would have liked to explore more of the diverse challenges faced by different migrant groups.

## Data Visualization Effectiveness

### Purposeful Visualizations
**Score: 2.5** - The visualizations effectively support the story, though I wish I had time to create more interactive elements and explore additional trends in the data.

### Intuitive Visual Design
**Score: 3** - I'm confident in the clarity of the visual design, with consistent color schemes and clear hierarchies guiding the viewer's understanding.

### Gestalt Principles Application
**Score: 2.5** - The use of color and size works well to highlight important information, though I could have better utilized proximity and grouping to show relationships between different aspects of the story.

### Reading Order and Information Hierarchy
**Score: 2.5** - The layout guides viewers through the content effectively, though I could have better emphasized connections between personal narratives and broader trends.

### Helpful Annotations
**Score: 2.5** - The captions and annotations provide good context, though I would have liked to add more detailed guidance for the interactive elements.

### Map Design
**Score: 2.5** - The maps are clear and functional, though I would have loved to create more detailed micro-maps of specific regions and routes.

### Interactive Elements
**Score: 2.5** - The interactive elements add value to the story, though I wish I had time to create more, particularly a comparative analysis of different migration routes.

## Areas for Potential Enhancement

Given more time, I would focus on:

1. **Diverse Perspectives**: Include more personal stories from different regions
2. **Regional Detail**: Create micro-maps of specific regions, especially the Caribbean
3. **Interactive Analysis**: Develop tools for comparing different migration routes
4. **Data Exploration**: Uncover and visualize additional trends in the data
5. **Enhanced Interactivity**: Add more detailed information layers to existing maps

## Overall Assessment

I'm proud of what I've accomplished while recognizing there's always room for growth. The project effectively tells a story through both personal narratives and data, though I would have loved to explore more perspectives and create additional interactive elements. The integration of Alisa's story with broader trends works well, but I see opportunities to make the story even richer with more diverse voices and experiences.
